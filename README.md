# Tribute Page
This single page project illustrates one of the tamplates of a real tribute-webpage.<br>
Care was taken to make sure the page is responsive and mobile friendly.<br>
Besides the grid and flexbox concepts, there were also used media queries and much more features make it completely responsive. <br>
Completing this project was one of the requirements for the <strong>freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification.</strong>
