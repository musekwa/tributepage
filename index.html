            Donald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is the 45th and current

            a businessman and television personality.

            Trump was born and raised in Queens, a borough of New York 
            City, and received a bachelor's degree in economics from the 
            Wharton School. He took charge of his family's real-estate 
            business in 1971, renamed it The Trump Organization, and 
            expanded its operations from Queens and Brooklyn into 
            Manhattan. The company built or renovated skyscrapers, hotels, 
            casinos, and golf courses. Trump later started various side 
            ventures, mostly by licensing his name. He bought the Miss 
            Universe brand of beauty pageants in 1996, and sold it in 2015. 
            He produced and hosted The Apprentice, a reality television 
            series, from 2003 to 2015. As of 2020, Forbes estimated his net 
            worth to be $2.1 billion.
